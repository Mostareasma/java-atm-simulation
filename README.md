**ATM machine functionalities:**

Check Balance: Display the account balance to the user.

Withdraw: Allow the user to withdraw cash from their account. The user should be prompted to enter the amount they want to withdraw, and the program should deduct the amount from the account balance if the balance is sufficient. If the balance is insufficient, the program should display an appropriate error message.

Deposit: Allow the user to deposit cash into their account. The user should be prompted to enter the amount they want to deposit, and the program should add the amount to the account balance.

Change PIN: Allow the user to change their PIN. The user should be prompted to enter their current PIN and their new PIN. If the current PIN is correct, the program should update the PIN with the new value.

Exit: Allow the user to exit the program.

The program should display a menu of options to the user and prompt them to choose an option. The user should be able to perform multiple operations in a single session before exiting the program. The program should also validate user input to ensure that it is of the correct type and within a valid range.
ATM: This class will contain the main method that starts the program and interacts with the user.

BankAccount: This class will represent the user's bank account and store the account balance, PIN, and other relevant information.

ATMOperations: This interface will define the methods for the ATM operations, including checkBalance(), withdraw(), deposit(), and changePIN().

ATMImpl: This class will implement the ATMOperations interface and provide the implementation for the ATM operations.

InputValidator: This class will provide methods to validate user input and ensure that it is of the correct type and within a valid range.

ATMException: This class will define custom exception types that the program can throw in case of errors or invalid input.

ATMConstants: This class will contain constant values used throughout the program, such as maximum withdrawal limits or PIN length.

As for the packages, you could create a single package atm to contain all the classes and interfaces.

I hope this helps you and your students in creating a structured and organized program.
